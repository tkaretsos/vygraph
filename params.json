{"name":"Vygraph","tagline":"","body":"# vygraph\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* **LLVM, Clang and Clang-tools source code.**  \r\nCurrent version is 3.4. Probably works with the newest version, but it's not tested.\r\n\r\n* **CMake**  \r\nVersion 2.8.1 or higher.\r\n\r\n* **g++**  \r\nVersion 4.8.1 or higher.\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\nvygraph is using the Clang's build system. Read more [here](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html).  \r\nI provide two scripts to make things a bit simpler, because vygraph's source directory lies under a  \r\ndifferent directory from the LLVM/Clang source code. Here are the two scripts:  \r\n\r\n#### download_llvm\r\nThis script is only for downloading and extracting the required LLVM and Clang sources. If you already  \r\nhave the sources of LLVM, Clang and [Clang tools](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangTools.html), it is not required to execute this script.  \r\n\r\n`sh download_llvm <directory>`\r\n\r\nwhere `<directory>` is the directory where you want the sources to be downloaded and extracted.  \r\nWhen this script is executed, it will generate the file `llvm_dirs` which contains the paths for  \r\nthe source, build and bin directories of LLVM. You can use this file with the next script, in order  \r\nto configure the project.\r\n\r\n#### configure\r\nThis script helps set the current project as a tool project of Clang, so when you build LLVM and Clang  \r\nthis project will be built as well. When you run this script you need to provide it with three directories.  \r\nThe LLVM source directory, the LLVM build directory and the LLVM bin directory:\r\n\r\n`sh configure <llvm_src_dir> <llvm_obj_dir> <llvm_bin_dir>`\r\n\r\nIf you previously ran the `download_llvm` script you can also:\r\n\r\n`sh configure $(cat llvm_dirs)`\r\n\r\nAfter `configure` script is executed successfully you can run `make` in the project directory and LLVM,  \r\nClang, Clang tools and this project will be built. \r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nIf you do not have the sources of LLVM and Clang:  \r\n\r\n`sh download_llvm ..`  \r\n`sh configure ($cat llvm_dirs)`  \r\n`make`  \r\n\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nAfter the project has been successfully built, a symlink to the executable will be created in the project's  \r\nroot directory (`vygraph`). Execute it and give a C source code file as an input:\r\n\r\n`./vygraph my_file.c --`\r\n\r\nThe two dashes in the end are required by the tool.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
